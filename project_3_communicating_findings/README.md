# Factors affecting bike sharing: A case study of Ford GoBike Share

## by Emenike Goodluck


## Dataset

> There are 183412 riders recorded in the Ford GoBike Share dataset with 17 columns of which `start time`, `duration_sec`, `birth_year`, and `bike_share_for_all_trip`. After cleaning the dataset and we will be analyzing 174952 riders which represent 95% of the original dataset. The following additional columns `distance_meters`, `speed_mps`, `hour`, `day`, and `day_name` were created to aid the analysis.

> The users are categorized as either `customer` or `subscriber`

> Three genders participated `male`, `female` and `other` and some participants shared their rides during the trip

> I was interested to find out when are most trips taken in terms of time of day, day of the week, or month of the year? How long does the average trip take? Does the above depend on if a user is a subscriber or customer? And how the trip is affected based on the user type, age and gender.


## Summary of Findings

- The Ford GoBike Share was held in February 2019. Of the days of the month, day 28 at 08hrs had the highest number of participants. Similarly, most of the trips was taken on Thursdays at 17 hrs. Of all the days of the week, Saturdays and Sundays had the least number of participants and more participants turned up on weekdays. Also, most of the rides were made at 08 hrs and 17 hrs everyday.

- An average trip takes between 400 to 900 seconds with all the participants taking an average of 704 seconds. However, we saw that customers travelled for a longer time more than subscribers. This may be because none of the customers shared their rides. Although only 10% of the participants shared their rides, many of the subscribers travelled a shorter distance.

- Most of the participants are between the ages of 25 and 35. A great number of the participants are `male` which represents `75%` of the data. Of all the participants, most are `subscribers` while `10%` of the participants shared their rides throughout the trip.

- There is no correlation between participants' age and duration, distance travelled or speed of the rider.

- Younger participants shared their rides more than the older ones

- Those who did not share their rides travelled for a longer period than those who shared their rides

- Customers travelled for a longer time more than subscribers. This may be because none of the customers shared their rides.



## Key Insights for Presentation

- Participants who shared their rides travelled a shorter distance. This makes sense because they have to stop their ride along the way to give room for the other participant to participate in the ride. Since none of the customers shared their rides, customers rode longer than subscribers.

- Most of the rides were made at 08 hrs and 17 hrs everyday. This maybe because the participants want to take a ride before sunrise or a ride after sunset.
